# FakeShop
A fake clothing store website that uses React-Redux.

**NOTE:** This project is **IN PROCESS** and does **NOT** contain original CSS (as the purpose of the project is to apply what I have learned about react-redux) and closely follows a tutorial!

The tutorial being followed can be found [here](https://youtu.be/0W6i5LYKCSI).
